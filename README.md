# I am currently working on:

### [TileIR compiler](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/tile-ir/latest/index.html)
- A next-generation MLIR-based compiler infrastructure.
- Aims to provide a portable and composable intermediate representation for GPU programming in ML and HPC workloads.

### [CuTeDSL, Cutlass Python DSL](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/pythonDSL/cute_dsl.html)
- A Python-based DSL built on **MLIR** 
- Designed for writing high-performance GPU kernels with close-to-metal performance and integration with CUTLASS.
- [Watch my LLVM25 Talk: Cutlass Python DSL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NXd6MbKYNQ)

# Past Contributions

- Contributed to major compiler projects including:
  - [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) and [Flang](https://flang.llvm.org), [NVIDIA HPC Compilers](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-compilers) (formerly PGI), [MLIR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project), [IREE](https://github.com/iree-org/iree)
- Participated in the design of parallel programming models like:
  - [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org), [OpenACC](https://www.openacc.org/) for **C**, **C++**, and **Fortran**.
