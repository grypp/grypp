- My current focus is on the evolution of compilers to get the most out of GPU performance in ML and HPC.

- I contributed to clang, flang, and [NVIDIA HPC](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-compilers) (formerly PGI), [MLIR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) and [IREE](https://github.com/iree-org/iree)  compilers.

- Previously involved in designing parallel programming languages such as [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org) and [OpenACC](https://www.openacc.org/) for C, C++ and Fortran.
