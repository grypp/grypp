- My current focus is on optimizing compilers and programming languages for GPU utilization in ML and HPC. 

- I contributed to clang, flang, and [NVIDIA HPC](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-compilers) (formerly PGI), [MLIR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) and [IREE](https://github.com/iree-org/iree)  compilers.

- Previously involved in designing languages like [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org) and [OpenACC](https://www.openacc.org/).
