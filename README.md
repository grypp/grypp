### Current Work

#### Cutlass Python DSL
- Contributing to the [Cutlass Python DSL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass), a Python-based DSL built on **MLIR**.

#### TileIR
- Working on **TileIR** (coming soon), a next-generation MLIR-based compiler infrastructure.
- Aims to provide a portable and composable intermediate representation for GPU programming in ML and HPC workloads.

### Past Contributions

- Contributed to major compiler projects including:
  - [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) and [Flang](https://flang.llvm.org)
  - [NVIDIA HPC Compilers](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-compilers) (formerly PGI)
  - [MLIR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)
  - [IREE](https://github.com/iree-org/iree)
- Participated in the design of parallel programming models like:
  - [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org)
  - [OpenACC](https://www.openacc.org/)  
  For **C**, **C++**, and **Fortran**.


- Currently working on [Cutlass Python DSL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass) and [TileIR](coming soon) â€” both MLIR-based compiler infrastructures.

- Passionate about evolving compilers to maximize GPU performance for machine learning and HPC workloads.

- Previously contributed to Clang, Flang, [NVIDIA HPC](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-compilers) (formerly PGI), [MLIR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) and [IREE](https://github.com/iree-org/iree)  compilers.

- Actively involved in designing parallel programming models like [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org) and [OpenACC](https://www.openacc.org/) for C, C++, and Fortran.
